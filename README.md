# Codes for the Spectrometer Project as a part of the MRes Chemical Biology and Bio-entrepreneurship curriculum of the Hackspace.

This file contains the codes used for the spectrometer generated in the HackSpace. To run the codes, we will have to run the `code.py` file using CircuitPython. Other classes can be added for each individual function separately such as the code for a series of readings (example in the case of serial dilution) has already been added as the `fnc1.py`.
